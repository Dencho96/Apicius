                            explore, to find and to deliver an unrivalled product of superior quality, Apicius turned
                            the ambition
                            and daring of Marcus Gavius Apicius into the brand's own approach. The eccentric 1st century
                            Roman gourmet, whose life's purpose was to transform noble and refined foods into unique
                            recipes, drives and enhances the roots and values of the brand.

                            history of the area stretches back to 1756, Apicius believes that the immensity and quality

                            by the Douro allow it, even today, to continue to create, to innovate and to find rarities
